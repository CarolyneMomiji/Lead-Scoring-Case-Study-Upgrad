Objectives
X Education is an online course provider for industry professionals. The company gets leads from its website, online marketing, and referrals. Visitors on the website can browse courses, watch videos, or fill out a form with their contact details. When they provide contact information, they become leads. The sales team follows up with these leads through calls and emails, but only about 30% of them convert into paying customers.
X Education has a low lead conversion rate. Out of 100 leads, only about 30 become paying customers. The sales team spends a lot of time contacting all leads, including those unlikely to convert. This makes the process inefficient. The company wants to find "Hot Leads"—leads that are more likely to convert—so the sales team can focus on these.
